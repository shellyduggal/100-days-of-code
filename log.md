# 100 Days Of Code - Log


###Day 1: January 03, 2017
**Progress**: Forked my 1st Github repo! Started Javascript Drum Kit (JS30 challenge)

**Thoughts**: Got so caught up in my 'hour' of code that all of a sudden it had been 3 hours and I fell asleep before updating the log or pushing to Github. I've got a lot to learn. Google is my new best friend.

###Day 2: January 04, 2017
**Progress**: Finished JS Drum Kit (started yesterday), Starting JS30 Project #2 (Clock)

**Thoughts**: Hopefully I'll be very comfortable with Vanilla JS at the end of this!

###Day 3: January 05, 2017
**Progress**: Worked on FCC Weather App, initial setup completed, successfully obtained user location, struggling with making the right API call

**Thoughts**: Found some good resources on geolocation and best practices. Need to work with APIs more frequently to get more comfortable with them.
