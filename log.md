# 100 Days Of Code - Log


###Day 1: January 03, 2017
**Progress**: Forked my 1st Github repo! Started Javascript Drum Kit (JS30 challenge)

**Thoughts**: Got so caught up in my 'hour' of code that all of a sudden it had been 3 hours and I fell asleep before updating the log or pushing to Github. I've got a lot to learn. Google is my new best friend.

###Day 2: January 04, 2017
**Progress**: Finished JS Drum Kit (started yesterday), Starting JS30 Project #2 (Clock)

**Thoughts**: Hopefully I'll be very comfortable with Vanilla JS at the end of this!

###Day 3: January 05, 2017
**Progress**: Worked on FCC Weather App, initial setup completed, successfully obtained user location, struggling with making the right API call

**Thoughts**: Found some good resources on geolocation and best practices. Need to work with APIs more frequently to get more comfortable with them.

###Day 4: January 06, 2017
**Progress**: Continued work on FCC Weather App

**Thoughts**: Successfully found user location and displayed Fahrenheit weather data! Remaining steps: Add button to toggle Celsius, styling, and testing. I struggled with global variables not updating inside nested functions. Found a workaround, but it's messy. This is a topic I'll research further after I get this app working, I hope to return to the project later and clean it up.

###Days 5 & 6: January 07-08, 2017
**Progress**: Migrated to a new machine

**Thoughts**: Learned a lot about Git and various tools available to developers as I migrated to a new machine, making my development environment the priority of my setup

###Day 7: January 09, 2017
**Progress**: Worked on FCC Weather App - add weather icons, background image, update styling

**Thoughts**: Realized a better way to organize the code, it just came to me out of nowhere and I'm baffled I didn't think of it before! Looking forward to refactoring/reorganizing

###Day 8: January 10, 2017
**Progress**: Worked on FCC Weather App - add toggle for celsius/fahrenehit, add functions to lookup by zip code, update mobile styling

###Day 9: January 11, 2017
**Progress**: Redesign and update personal portfolio. Add separate contact page with detailed contact form

**Thoughts**: I did a lot of back and forth and repetitive CSS today. I am looking forward to learning how to use CSS tools like SASS to speed this process!

###Day 10: January 12, 2017
**Progress**: Portfolio Website - Responsive design completed. Deployed changes to live site, made a list of issues to correct. Learned *a lot* about XCode, Macports, and Homebrew. Created my first logo.

**Thoughts**: Excited to update my featured projects and add a blog. Inkscape installation gave me a headache, but I managed to push through and figure out my XCode problems myself without running to my husband to do it for me.

###Day 11: January 13, 2017
**Progress**: Completed all planned features for FCC Weather App and tested functionality. Next step: Responsive design

**Thoughts**: It was great to step away from this app for a couple of days. When I came back, it was with a clear head and I somehow knew the answers to the app's issues without having to think about it. I need to start learning about testing.
