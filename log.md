# 100 Days Of Code - Log

###**Day 1** January 03, 2017
**Progress**: Forked my 1st Github repo! Got so caught up in my 'hour' of code that all of a sudden it had been 3 hours and I fell asleep before updating the log or pushing to Github
**Worked on** Javascript Drum Kit (JS30 challenge)
**Thoughts** I've got a lot to learn. Google is my new best friend. 
**Links** [JS Drumkit](https://github.com/shellyduggal/01-JS30-Drumkit)
