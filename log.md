# 100 Days Of Code - Log

###Day 10: February 8, 2017
**Progress**: Continue work on Wikipedia Viewer for FCC

**Thoughts**: The Wikipedia API documentation is less thorough than I would expect, a lot of experimentation is needed to get the right data returned. It's probably a good experience, but I'm getting tired of going in circles with the docs!

###Day 8: February 6, 2017

Sick Day - Worked on soft skills



###Day 7: February 5, 2017
**Progress**: Work on Wikipedia Viewer for FCC

**Thoughts**: I decided to approach this project differently than I've approached other FCC projects: I'm doing the designing and front end first, leaving the API work and backend for later. I worry that I'm wasting time on design because I feel like I don't have a lot to show because nothing is functional yet - but we'll see how I feel about the process once I'm finished with everything.

###Day 4: February 2, 2017
**Progress**: Worked on building my first from-scratch WP theme 

**Thoughts**: Wordpress is a very interesting platform with so many possibilities. I'm glad I learned child themes and custom page templates before jumping into full theme development

###Day 3: February 1, 2017
**Progress**: Worked on algorithms for Project Euler problems in JS

**Thoughts**: I'd like to incorporate more of these coding challenges in my 100 days of code, rather than limiting myself to my personal projects

###Day 2: January 31, 2017
**Progress**: Design updates for FCC Quote Generator

**Thoughts**:

* Fixed now :)

###Day 1: January 30, 2017
**Progress**: Started Wikipedia Viewer project for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts**: 
* It's very easy and time-consuming to get caught up in color palettes! 
* Found an interesting way to make the footer stick to the bottom of the page - will need to test it out to make sure it works in different situations.

******************************************************************


###Day 15: January 18, 2017
**Progress**: Worked on Brad Schiff's Udemy course for 3-4 hours, took a lot of notes! 

**Thoughts**: Very excited to use Gulp and PostCSS in my next project! Also learned a great way to use an image as a background without making it a background-image, I believe I will be updating some old projects to include this.



###Day 0: January 17, 2017
**Progress**: Under the weather, forced to take the day off



###Day 14: January 16, 2017
**Progress**: Started converting a Python text adventure game I made a while back to JS so that it can be played in a browser

**Thoughts**: I learned quickly that things are going to get very complicated if I do this in Vanilla JS. I'll need to use jQuery and will probably use React when I learn that...

###Day 13: January 15, 2017
**Progress**: Actually completed FCC Weather App... Found out about SSL geolocation issues when I tried to submit the assignment and decided to switch to a different API for improved efficiency

**Thoughts**: I started out very upset with FCC for not mentioning the SSL conflict with OpenWeather API in the assignment instructions - It's been a known issue for at least 9 months! BUT, I am glad I chose to switch to a different API rather than working around the issue by using Firefox. I found that it's really not difficult to switch from one API to another, I learned a lot about error handling, and I feel that the new version of my app is much more efficient.

###Day 12: January 14, 2017
**Progress**: Completed FCC Weather App with additional features

**Thoughts**: Finished! Very glad I added the extra features, it was good practice with a variety of things

###Day 11: January 13, 2017
**Progress**: Completed all planned features for FCC Weather App and tested functionality. Next step: Responsive design

**Thoughts**: It was great to step away from this app for a couple of days. When I came back, it was with a clear head and I somehow knew the answers to the app's issues without having to think about it. I need to start learning about testing.

###Day 10: January 12, 2017
**Progress**: Portfolio Website - Responsive design completed. Deployed changes to live site, made a list of issues to correct. Learned *a lot* about XCode, Macports, and Homebrew. Created my first logo.

**Thoughts**: Excited to update my featured projects and add a blog. Inkscape installation gave me a headache, but I managed to push through and figure out my XCode problems myself without running to my husband to do it for me.

###Day 9: January 11, 2017
**Progress**: Redesign and update personal portfolio. Add separate contact page with detailed contact form

**Thoughts**: I did a lot of back and forth and repetitive CSS today. I am looking forward to learning how to use CSS tools like SASS to speed this process!

###Day 8: January 10, 2017
**Progress**: Worked on FCC Weather App - add toggle for celsius/fahrenehit, add functions to lookup by zip code, update mobile styling

**Thoughts**: Need to get form validation and onclick to work for looking up by zip code.

###Day 7: January 09, 2017
**Progress**: Worked on FCC Weather App - add weather icons, background image, update styling

**Thoughts**: Realized a better way to organize the code, it just came to me out of nowhere and I'm baffled I didn't think of it before! Looking forward to refactoring/reorganizing

###Days 5 & 6: January 07-08, 2017
**Progress**: Migrated to a new machine

**Thoughts**: Learned a lot about Git and various tools available to developers as I migrated to a new machine, making my development environment the priority of my setup

###Day 4: January 06, 2017
**Progress**: Continued work on FCC Weather App

**Thoughts**: Successfully found user location and displayed Fahrenheit weather data! Remaining steps: Add button to toggle Celsius, styling, and testing. I struggled with global variables not updating inside nested functions. Found a workaround, but it's messy. This is a topic I'll research further after I get this app working, I hope to return to the project later and clean it up.

###Day 3: January 05, 2017
**Progress**: Worked on FCC Weather App, initial setup completed, successfully obtained user location, struggling with making the right API call

**Thoughts**: Found some good resources on geolocation and best practices. Need to work with APIs more frequently to get more comfortable with them.

###Day 2: January 04, 2017
**Progress**: Finished JS Drum Kit (started yesterday), Starting JS30 Project #2 (Clock)

**Thoughts**: Hopefully I'll be very comfortable with Vanilla JS at the end of this!

###Day 1: January 03, 2017
**Progress**: Forked my 1st Github repo! Started Javascript Drum Kit (JS30 challenge)

**Thoughts**: Got so caught up in my 'hour' of code that all of a sudden it had been 3 hours and I fell asleep before updating the log or pushing to Github. I've got a lot to learn. Google is my new best friend.
